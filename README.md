# Arithmetic Multiplier Benchmark Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of arithmetic multiplier benchmarks in **AIG (And-Inverter Graph)** format. These benchmarks are designed for evaluating logic synthesis, formal verification, and arithmetic circuit optimization algorithms.

## Dataset Overview

The benchmarks primarily consist of **64x64-bit** multipliers generated using various open-source arithmetic circuit generators. The dataset covers a wide range of architectures by combining different Partial Product Generators (PPG), Partial Product Accumulators (PPA), and Final Stage Adders (FSA).

### Generators Used

* **GenMul**: [https://github.com/amahzoon/genmul](https://github.com/amahzoon/genmul)
* **MultGen**: [https://github.com/temelmertcan/multgen](https://github.com/temelmertcan/multgen)
* **Akoi**: [https://fmv.jku.at/amulet2/](https://fmv.jku.at/amulet2/) (Note: The original website for Akoi is no longer accessible. We retrieved the benchmarks in an alternative website.)

## Directory Structure

The benchmarks are organized by signedness and the tool used for generation:

```text
.
├── signed/
│   ├── genmul/      # Generated by GenMul (Signed)
│   ├── multgen/     # Generated by MultGen (Signed)
│   └── akoi/        # Generated by Akoi (Signed)
└── unsigned/
    ├── genmul/      # Generated by GenMul (Unsigned)
    ├── multgen/     # Generated by MultGen (Unsigned)
    └── akoi/        # Generated by Akoi (Unsigned)

```

## Naming Convention

Files are generally named using the following pattern to identify the architecture:

`[PPG]-[PPA]-[FSA].aig`

* **PPG (Partial Product Generator):** e.g., `sp` (Simple/AND), `bp` (Booth).
* **PPA (Partial Product Accumulator):** e.g., `ar` (Array), `wt` (Wallace Tree), `dt` (Dadda Tree).
* **FSA (Final Stage Adder):** e.g., `rc` (Ripple Carry), `ks` (Kogge-Stone), `lf` (Ladner-Fischer).

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### GenMul / Signed / Array Multiplier

Due to a specific bug in the **GenMul** tool, the generation of the **Signed Array Multiplier with Carry Skip Adder** fails during the Verilog generation phase.

* **Missing File:** `sp-ar-cs.aig`
* **Location:** `signed/genmul/`

Consequently, the `signed/genmul/` directory contains **27** benchmarks instead of the expected 28. All other combinations were generated successfully.
